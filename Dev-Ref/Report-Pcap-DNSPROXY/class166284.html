<p>The function prototype used for method functions (or caller-provided<br />callbacks) that merge two file specifications. They are passed a DSO<br />structure pointer (or NULL if they are to be used independently of a DSO<br />object) and two file specifications to merge. They should either return<br />NULL (if there is an error condition) or a newly allocated string<br />containing the result of merging that the caller will need to free with<br />OPENSSL_free() when done. Here, merging means that bits and pieces are<br />taken from each of the file specifications and added together in whatever<br />fashion that is sensible for the DSO method in question.  The only rule<br />that really applies is that if the two specification contain pieces of the<br />same type, the copy from the first string takes priority.  One could see<br />it as the first specification is the one given by the user and the second<br />being a bunch of defaults to add on if they're missing in the first.<br /><br /></p>
